# Several customizable Reddit bots

> This codebase does not contain any tools for finetuning models. It assumes you have either a local pretrained model, or wish to use a huggingface model.  
> Check your model's documentation for finetuning instructions.

Features:

- GPT2, GPTJ text generation
- Basic database handling
- Example bot script

Todo:

- Support Blenderbot 1 and 2
- GPT and Blenderbot sequence classification
- Sanitize database inputs
- Add more example scripts
- Add documentation
- Remove database abstraction(?) I'm not sure if it's nescessary..

**This codebase is very young. Expect bugs and incomplete features.**
